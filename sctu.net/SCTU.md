We are a group of tenants in Somerville and Cambridge fighting gentrification and building working class power. Landlords — both corporate & individual — are making huge profits off the fact that they own real estate and we don’t.

We believe that unless tenants fight together autonomously (independent from politicians, non–profits, and business owners), rents will continue to spike, people will continue to be displaced, and landlords will continue to exploit us.

Are you a renter in Cambridge or Somerville? **Join us!**
