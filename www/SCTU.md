The **Somerville Cambridge Tenants Union** is a new tenant-led organization fighting for safe, decent, and affordable housing for all.

Rent is skyrocketing, people are being displaced from their neighborhoods, and many renters live in unsafe or unsanitary housing because their landlords refuse to make repairs. We fight against poor conditions, landlord harassment, and displacement by building tenant power. Join us!
